# Market Basket Analysis

**Introduction**

In this project, a Market Basket Analysis algorithm was applied to study customer behavior and analyze data to improve services. The dataset consists of nine files, with five key files selected for analysis: category_name, products, orders, payments, and items. This analysis aims to enhance marketing strategies and improve services that meet customer needs.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset is relatively large and includes the following key files:
- category_name: Names of product categories in English and Brazilian Portuguese.
- products: Details of available products.
- orders: Records of customer orders.
- payments :Information about payment methods.
- items: Details of items purchased within orders.

**Data Processing**
  
The process began with loading the selected files and cleaning the data to remove missing values and duplicates. Various analyses were then conducted, including identifying:
- The months with the highest sales.
- The year with the highest sales.
- The top-selling products regardless of the year.

These analyses provide insights into customer behavior and sales trends.

**Results**

The visualizations provided clear and accurate results. Overall, the findings were understandable, although some results were slightly unclear. Nevertheless, the general outcome remains positive.

**Future Recommendations**

1. Utilize Advanced Analytics: Implement machine learning techniques to predict future sales trends, enhancing inventory management and marketing strategies.
2. Regularly Update Data: Establish a routine for updating the dataset to capture current sales trends and customer preferences, ensuring the analysis remains relevant.
