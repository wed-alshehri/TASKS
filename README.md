**Naive Bayes Classifier:**

**Introduction**

This project analyzes diabetes data using the Naive Bayes algorithm, focusing on characteristics like glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI to predict diabetes risk. It serves as a tool for individuals to assess their risk and helps healthcare providers identify those needing further testing.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset contains 768 entries, each representing an individual with the following health metrics:
- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL).
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- Insulin: Serum insulin concentration (μU/mL).
- BMI: Body Mass Index (kg/m²).
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- Age: Age in years.
- Outcome: Diabetes status (1 for diabetes, 0 for non-diabetes).

**Data Source**

The "Diabetes Dataset" used in this project is available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

**Steps Taken**

1. Data Download: Downloaded the diabetes dataset for analysis.
2. Naive Bayes Model Application: Applied Naive Bayes algorithm for diabetes risk prediction.
3. Results Evaluation: Compared Naive Bayes performance with logistic regression.
4. Logistic Regression Implementation: Implemented logistic regression on the same dataset.
5. Results Comparison: Found that both models achieved an accuracy of 74.46%, indicating similar predictive performance.

**Results**

Both the Naive Bayes and logistic regression models achieved an accuracy of 74.46%, indicating good performance. The comparable accuracy suggests that the dataset is robust for predictions.

**Future Recommendations**

Further exploration of additional algorithms, such as ensemble methods, and investigation into feature engineering and data augmentation could enhance model performance.
